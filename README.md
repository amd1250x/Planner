# Welcome to Planner!

This is an application developed for me. You can use and change stuff to your liking, but my needs will be above anyone elses needs for this application.

When you start the program, you get:

Planner:

You can do your commands now.

* add:  Add a task based on subject, name, and date it is due.
* show: Show all of the tasks.
* quit: Quit the program.
