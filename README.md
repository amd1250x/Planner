# Welcome to Planner

This is an application developed for me. You can use and change stuff to your liking, but my needs will be above anyone elses needs for this application.

## CLI

When you start the program, you get:

Planner:

You can do your commands now.

* add:    Add a task based on subject, name, and date it is due.
* show:   Show all of the tasks.
* get:    Get your tasks from the data file.
* write:  Write tasks to data file.
* remove: Remove a task.
* quit:   Quit the program.

##GUI

The GUI is still in progress, but these are functions you can use:

* Add Task
* Remove Task
* For Tomorrow - This is still in progress

- In addition, you can view your tasks on the main page.
- Tasks in red mean that the date due for the task has passed.
